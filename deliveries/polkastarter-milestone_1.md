Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which should be used for testing.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | Crowdloan DApp |...| This the main deliverable and it includes a web based application that interacts with the westend runtime. | 
| 2.  | Polkadot launch config file |...| Public networks do not support the crowdloan module; thus we'll have to run a local netwrok using the polkadot-launch cli too. This will spin up the westend runtime which has integrated the crowdloan module. We'll be using this local runtime to interact with the module. | 
| 3.  | Westend runtime binary |...| This is a pre-built binary of the westend runtime that includes the crowdloan module.|
| 4.  | Documentation |...| A thorough description of the crowdloan module and how one can interact by sending extrinsics either via the Polkadot.js Apps or the Polkastarter Crowdloan DApp.|
